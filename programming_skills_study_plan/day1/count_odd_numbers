Count Odd Numbers in an Interval Range


Keep time and space complexity in mind 
hint - a range has half even and half odd numbers











class Solution(object):
    def countOdds(self, low, high):
        """
        :type low: int
        :type high: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        return (high + 1) // 2 - (low // 2)
